# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The newest version is only supported to fix vulnerabilities / bugs. So if you want to get the fix, please download the newest version from GitHub releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerabilities in SimpleCom, please report to yasuenag@gmail.com . Not file GitHub issue and/or public them to prevent zero-day attacks.  
I will assess your report and fix ASAP. If I determine that your report is not a vulnerability, I will file it to GitHub issue as a bug with your credit.
